> ⚠️ **Warning** ⚠️: This virus was created purely for educational and experimental purposes. The creator, ABOLHB, is **NOT** responsible for any harm caused by its use. **Proceed with caution!** This virus embodies the indomitable spirit of Stalin's rule, seizing full control of your system as if it were under Soviet command!

## 👹 **Overview** 👹

The **Stalin Virus** is a terrifying digital presence, designed to bring the user face-to-face with the intensity of Soviet-era power. Crafted in C#, this virus disrupts system operations with a relentless, iron-clad grip. It visually distorts the screen with red and yellow effects, randomly moves icons and the mouse, and even tampers with the **MBR (Master Boot Record)** to leave a lasting mark—just like the shadow of the Soviet Union! 🛠️🔨

> **Note**: You can replace the default name "ABOLHB" displayed by the virus with your own for personalization.

## 🌍 **Key Features** 🌍

- **Screen Glitching**: The virus floods the screen with glitch effects in Soviet-inspired colors, displaying slogans like "CONTROL" and "POWER" alongside Soviet icons for a chaotic visual atmosphere.
- **Random Icon Display**: Icons mimicking Soviet symbols, like the hammer and sickle, appear randomly to enforce a sense of controlled disorder.
- **Mouse Interference**: Just as authority was exercised without opposition, this virus disrupts control by taking over the mouse, moving it unpredictably.
- **MBR Tampering**: With a deep level of system interference, the virus modifies the MBR, making its influence hard to erase and leaving an indelible mark on the machine.
- **Disturbing Audio**: Plays mechanical, industrial sounds reminiscent of Soviet factories, immersing the user in a chilling, authoritarian ambiance.

## ☠️ **How It Works** ☠️

The **Stalin Virus** operates through several unyielding threads, each representing an aspect of Soviet control:

1. **Screen Effects**: Soviet-style colors and symbols flash on the screen, with the name "Stalin" appearing in bold letters, asserting dominance over the system.
2. **Mouse Interference**: The virus seizes control of the cursor, randomly moving it across the screen to disrupt any attempt at user resistance.
3. **MBR Modification**: By manipulating the Master Boot Record, the virus leaves a permanent mark—echoing Stalin’s lasting influence in history.
4. **Audio Effects**: Plays unsettling, metallic sounds, evoking the atmosphere of Soviet industry and adding to the sense of oppression.

## 🛑 **Disclaimer** 🛑

This project was created solely for educational and experimental purposes. **Do not deploy** this virus on any unauthorized systems. Misuse can lead to severe damage, and ABOLHB accepts no responsibility for any consequences resulting from improper use.
